# BOM

## OTC parts
- 1x NEMA34 stepper motor of your choice
- 1x 400mm linear rail with MGN12H carriage
- 1x Stepper motor driver ..and a way to control it TBA, in the meantime OSSM controller might work?

## 3D printed parts
- 1x Baseplate
- 1x Bearing holder
- 1x Bearing spacer (print in TPU for best fit)
- 1x Enclosure
- 1x Pinion for 14mm shaft with keyway
- 1x Rack (prints in 2 pieces)
- 1x 24mm rail thread mount
- 1x 24mm toy mount to taste

## Hardware
### Rail & attachments
- 12x 2.5x12mm wood screws
- 4x M3x12mm bolts
- 6x M3 lock nuts
- 4x M3x20mm machine screws
- 1x 5x80mm wood screw (for the Vac-u-lock adapter)

### Motor assembly
- 4x M5x30mm bolts
- 4x M5 lock nuts
- 2x M6x80mm bolts
- 2x M6 lock nuts

# How to assemble

1. Fit M3x12mm bolts with double lock nuts into the 3rd mounting hole from one side of the rail, as well as the very last mounting hole on the other side, these will act as hard stops to prevent the rail from leaving the bearing carriage
2. Attach the 24mm rail thread mount to the last two mounting holes on the end of the linear rail with two M3x12mm bolts
3. Attach the two rack pieces to the rail with 2.5x12mm wood screws, the two pieces should fit end to end, run the pinion across before tightening to ensure proper alignment
4. Mount the linear rail carriage to the bearing holder + bearing spacer with four M3x20mm machine screws, use loctite to prevent the screws from loosening with vibration
5. Mount the base plate to the front face of the motor using only two M5x30mm bolts on the bearing side, the bolts on the other side will be fitted after the enclosure is on
6. Mate the pinion to the motor shaft, the top of the pinion should be flush with the top of the shaft
7. Place the bottom part of the bearing holder into its final position on the base plate, then attach the enclosure to the top side, the parts should loosely stay in place without fastening
8. This is the perfect time to make sure the controller is working as expected, beyond this step there may be damage to the machine if the rail is driven past its limits
9. Fit the M6x80mm bolts through the top of the enclosure, the bearing holder and the baseplate
10. Fit the remaining two M5x30mm bolts through the enclosure, the base plate and the front face of the motor
11. If using the Vac-u-lock adapter, run the 5x80mm wood screw through the hole in the bottom, do not be tempted to skip this step, the plastic will crack even with moderate use!
12. This machine is incredibly powerful, be safe and make sure it can be switched off immediately if there is a problem
13. Enjoy!
